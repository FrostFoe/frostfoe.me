My personal website, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Upstash](https://upstash.com?ref=chronark.com), [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) and deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Running Locally

First, clone the repository:

```sh-session
git clone https://github.com/chronark/chronark.com.git
cd chronark.com
```

Create a `.env` file similar to `.env.example`. You'll need to add your Upstash Redis credentials.

Then, install the dependencies and run the development server:

```sh-session
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
